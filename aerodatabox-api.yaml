        powered by webhooks.  \r

        If you are running your own web service, you can subscribe to flights by
        number or airport code. \r

        After that, your HTTP endpoint will be called (notified) whenever the
        flight information gets \r

        updated.*\r

        \r

        Creates a web-hook subscription on a subject (e.g., flight alerts by
        number or by airport code).\r

        Returns information about created subscription. Subscription ID
        contained in it\r

        can be used to refresh or remove it.\r

        \r

        If subscription contains an expiration date-time, it will auto-expire
        automatically\r

        on this time. If you want to prevent expiration, use
        `webhook/{subscriptionId}/refresh` \r

        endpoint to refresh the subscription.\r

        \r

        Every time a subject gets updated, a HTTP request will be sent to\r

        the URL specified in `url` parameter. Request will be of a POST type \r

        and contain JSON-formatted `FlightNotificationContract` object
        containing subscription\r

        and flights information in  the body (see example response for status
        code 199\r

        of this endpoint documentation).\r

        \r

        All flight alerts / notifications are delivered in best-effort manner.
        They might be missing\r

        or delayed. If there was an error delivering a notification for any
        reason,\r

        there will be 2 more retries after 5 and 15 minutes (precise numbers
        might change).\r

        \r

        If subscribed to a specific flight or to flights operated in a specific
        airport:\r

        * Ensure that the flight is within the live updates / ADS-B data
        coverage. There is no sense in subscribing to a flight which operates in
        airports having poor or  no live updates or ADS-B coverage: there simply
        will be no updates. To check if an airport is tracked and on which
        level, use `/health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds` endpoint. You can
        also use `/health/services/feeds/{service}/airports` to get the list of
        covered airports. Read more about coverage here:
        https://www.aerodatabox.com/data-coverage.\r

        * Notifications will cover updates for flights commencing from 6 hours
        ago up to 72 hours in future.\r

        * Among these, notifications will contain only those flight items which
        were actually updated this time."

        nearest date (either in past or in future).\r

        \r

        A flight can be searched by:\r

        * flight number it's being operated under; or\r

        * ATC-callsign it's being operated under; or\r

        **What is the historical status or schedule of a specific flight on a
        specific date in past or in future?**\r

        \r

        This endpoint returns data about a specific flight  live flight status
        (if the flight is within the coverage and not in distant future), \r

        or flight schedule data otherwise.\r

        \r

        If `dateLocal` is specified, gets data about flight(s) departing or
        arriving on the day specified (local time).\r

        Otherwise, gets data about the status of flight(s) operating on the
        nearest date (either in past or in future).\r

        \r

        A flight can be searched by:\r

        * flight number it's being operated under; or\r

        * ATC-callsign it's being operated under; or\r

        * tail-number of the aircraft it's being operated by; or\r

        * Mode-S 24-bit ICAO Transponder address of the aircraft it's being
        operated by.\r

        \r

        Flight data may include airport of arrival and departure, scheduled and
        actual times, flight status, type of aircraft, \r

        tail-number and aircraft image.\r

        \r

        Some flights may have partial data. The data may be absent for either
        arrival \r

        or departure airport or may not include live updates of time and status.
        Check quality markers inside the response to \r

        determine which data is available.\r

        \r

        Normally, information with live status updates and estimated/actual
        arrival/departure times is only available \r

        for airports tracked live or with ADS-B by our system. Otherwise flight
        information will be with scheduled info only \r

        or absent. \r

        \r

        To check if an airport is currently tracked and on which level, \r

        use `/health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds` endpoint. You can also use
        `/health/services/feeds/{service}/airports` to get \r

        the list of covered airports. \r

        \r

        Aircraft images are being searched in external sources by certain
        criteria without any manual intervention. \r

        Therefore, false matches may be returned. Only images with licenses
        approved for commercial use are returned. \r

        Flights may contain live updates with corresponding information related
        to the actual progress of the flight \r

        (including actual/estimated arrival/departure times). In this case this
        endpoint serves as a FIDS endpoint. \r

        Presense of live updates is subject to data coverage: not all airports
        have this coverage in our system.\r

        Otherwise flight information will be limited to scheduled only and will
        not be updated real-time. Much more airports\r

        have this type of coverage. To check if airport is tracked and on which
        level, use */health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds* endpoint. \r

        You can also use */health/services/feeds/{service}/airports* to get the
        list of supported airports for this\r

        or that layer of coverage. To learn more about the data coverage, refer

              all aircraft typically operating on those distances.</li>

              <li><b>1 - ML01</b>: Experimental machine learning (ML) model,
              which attempts to provide more accurate prediction of the flight
              time by taking into account the history of flights on specified
              route and aircraft type within the recent year. This may come in
              handy in case when on certain routes flights take significant
              detours due to extended airspace closures dictated by war
              conflicts, sanction regulations, etc. This can result in
              significantly increased flight times comparing to regular
              estimations. Or, some routes generally experience longer delays
              than other routes of the same distance. This model attempts to
              take such factors into account and reflect it in the prediction.
              If a model cannot be applied due to lack of historical and/or
              aircraft data or prediction is too off set, it automatically
              fallbacks to `Standard`.</li>

        Models of calculating the flight time.<p>Possible values:</p>

        <ul>

        <li><b>0 - Standard</b>: Standard model of calculation which takes into
        account the great circle distance and the average speed of all aircraft
        typically operating on those distances.</li>

        <li><b>1 - ML01</b>: Experimental machine learning (ML) model, which
        attempts to provide more accurate prediction of the flight time by
        taking into account the history of flights on specified route and
        aircraft type within the recent year. This may come in handy in case
        when on certain routes flights take significant detours due to extended
        airspace closures dictated by war conflicts, sanction regulations, etc.
        This can result in significantly increased flight times comparing to
        regular estimations. Or, some routes generally experience longer delays
        than other routes of the same distance. This model attempts to take such
        factors into account and reflect it in the prediction. If a model cannot
        be applied due to lack of historical and/or aircraft data or prediction
        is too off set, it automatically fallbacks to `Standard`.</li>
