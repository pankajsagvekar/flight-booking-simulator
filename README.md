# flight-booking-simulator
✈️ A simple Flight Booking Simulator built using FastAPI and SQLite, developed as part of the Infosys Internship. It allows users to view available flights, search by origin, destination, and date, sort by price or duration, and simulate external airline data — representing a basic real-world flight booking backend system.
